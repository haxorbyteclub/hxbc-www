### Command History
- Use ‚Üë (Up Arrow) and ‚Üì (Down Arrow) to navigate through command history
- Commands are automatically saved to history (duplicates are filtered)
- `history` command displays numbered list of all previous commands

### Auto-Scroll
- Terminal automatically scrolls to bottom when new output is added
- Ensures latest commands and output are always visible

### Focus Management
- Input field maintains focus for seamless typing experience
- Focus is restored after command execution

### Responsive Design
- Terminal window is resizable (600x400px default)
- Scrollable output area with custom dark theme scrollbar
- Monospace font (Courier New) for authentic terminal appearance

### Visual Theme
- Dark terminal theme with green prompt text (#00ff00)
- Black background (#0c0c0c) with light text
- Realistic terminal prompt: `user@haxorbyte:~$`

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
- Built as Blazor component inheriting from `AppBase`
- Uses `@bind` for two-way data binding on input
- Manages command history and output lines in component state

### Event Handling
- `@onkeypress` for capturing Enter, Up Arrow, and Down Arrow keys
- Async command execution with state updates
- JavaScript interop for focus management and scrolling

### Safety Features
- Commands that could be destructive (like `rm`) are safely mocked
- No actual file system or network operations are performed
- All outputs are simulated for entertainment and education

## Usage Tips
1. Type `help` to see all available commands
2. Try the easter egg commands for fun surprises
3. Use tab completion isn't implemented, but command history navigation works
4. All file operations are virtual - no real files are affected
5. Experiment with different command combinations and arguments

## Contributing
To add new commands:
1. Add the command case to the `ProcessCommand` method switch statement
2. Create a handler method for complex commands
3. Update this documentation with the new command details
4. Consider adding easter eggs and fun responses to maintain the playful nature

The terminal is designed to be educational, entertaining, and safe while providing an authentic command-line experience for users of the HaxorByte Club application.
